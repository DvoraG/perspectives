# Development of my website "perspectives"

This will be an ongoing project. In the moment I am using WordPress, but being more a developer than a blogger I want to create my own stuff.
And eventually this shall lead to develop templates and webapps for others. So this is the journey: starting from here with using HTML5 and CSS3 (and a tiny bit of JS) I intend to move it up to React or Gatsby.
